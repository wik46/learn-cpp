#include <iostream> //Remember all that the #inlcude statement does is copy and paiste
#include <cstdlib>
//Keywords: int,double, struct, class, return, break, static, new.... ( Words that have special meaning to the compiler)

// The keyword struct: announces that this is a structure type definition;wq

// The name of a structure data type is called a struct tag. This tag can be any legal identifier but not a keyword

//Remember time g++ file.cpp
//Remember g++ -std=c++11 file.cpp
