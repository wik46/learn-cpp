# cs162

### Created by Wikus Jansen van Rensburg.
The repository is a way to save all my practise code from cs 162 at Oregon State University.
# learn-cpp
Source code that contains various examples of fundamentals of C++.

The purpose of this repository is learning how to use Github and I submitted C++ code 
that I wrote while studying during my first CS class in college.
