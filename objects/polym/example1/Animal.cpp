 * Filename: Animal.cpp
 * Author: Lodewyk Jansen van Rensburg.
 * Description: This is the file for my Animal class. This class will be frequently used.
 * 		One thing to take note of that each type of animal will be stored in
 * 		a "cage". That is an array of the desired type. 
 * 		Animals are babies if they are between [0,6] months old. 
 * 		-	They will have a birth date if they were born in the zoo.
 *		- 	If they were born outside the Zoo they arrive at the zoo
 *			at age 4.
 *		- 	The "cages" - array of the types - will keep track of the number
 *			of babies and adults in the zoo.
 *		-	An adult is any animal 4 years or greater.
 *		- 	Any non-adult cannot give birth to a baby.
 *		- 	Each specie gives birth to a set number of babies.

 * 		An animal is a baby if it is 6 or less months old. Babies cost
 * 		twice as much to take care of when they are sick, but the
 * 		earn twice as much revenu as an adult. Babies cannot deliver babies.
 * Parameters: -
 * Input: Note that it is a const function.
 * Output: A boolean value depending in the Animal instance's age.

 * 			  Adult cost: Half the intial cost of the animal.

 * 		Bears: 10% of initial cost.
 * 		Tigers: 10% of intitial cost.
 * 		Sea lions: 20% of initial cost.
 * Parameters: int - A random event can occure where the sea lion exibition get a boom
 * 		in attendance. The integer passed in as the argument will be the 
 * 		additional revenue earned.
 * Input: The function will be called fore each intance of an Animal or any inherited
 * 	  class once per round/"month".
 * Output: The function returns the floating point number associated with the 
 * 	   revenue earned from owning the animal.
